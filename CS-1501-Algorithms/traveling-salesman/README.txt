INTRODUCTION

This program implements a modified version of Prim's algorithm to find the MST between any number of Pseudo-randomly generated cities. The algorithm I have designed calculates the weight of the MST as well as the tour of all cities by doing a pre-order traversal of the graph.

INSTALLATION

The following files should be present:

	City.java
	Map.java
	MST.java
	MSTTour.java
	README.txt

Compiled and tested with JDK version 11.0.4 (newer versions should also work):

	javac MSTTour.java
	java MSTTour

USAGE

See MSTTour.java for an example of usage.

PROBLEMS

No known problems.

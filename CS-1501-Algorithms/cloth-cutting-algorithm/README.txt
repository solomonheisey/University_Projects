Cloth-Cutting Dynamic Programming Algorithm

October 2019

INTRODUCTION

This program implements a top-down recursive approach to the cloth cutting problem. To speed
up the performance of the program a two-dimensional integer array was implemented to store the optimal values and keep track of overlapping subproblems. Additionally, I used ArrayLists to keep track of the cut coordinates. 

INSTALLATION

The following files should be present:

	Cloth.java
	ClothCuttingAlgorithm.java
	FittedPattern.java
	GUI.java
	Memo.java
	Pattern.java
	Tuple.java

Compiled and tested with JDK version 11.0.4 (newer versions should also work):

	javac ClothCuttingAlgorithm.java
	java ClothCuttingAlgorithm


USAGE

See TestClothCutter.java for an example of usage.

PROBLEMS

No known problems.

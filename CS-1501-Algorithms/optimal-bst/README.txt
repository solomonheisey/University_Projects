October 2019

INTRODUCTION

This program implements a top-down recursive approach to finding the optimal BST. To speed
up the performance of the program a two-dimensional BinaryTree array was implemented to store the matrices and
keep track of overlapping subproblems.

INSTALLATION

The following files should be present:

	BinaryTree.java
	BSTOptimizer.java
	CNode.java
	NodeData.java
	OptimizeBST.java
	README.txt

Compiled and tested with JDK version 11.0.4 (newer versions should also work):

	javac OptimizeBST.java
	java OptimizeBST

USAGE

See OptimizeBST.java for an example of usage.

PROBLEMS

No known problems.

public class GameOfLifePinningTest {
	/*
	 * READ ME: You may need to write pinning tests for methods from multiple
	 * classes, if you decide to refactor methods from multiple classes.
	 * 
	 * In general, a pinning test doesn't necessarily have to be a unit test; it can
	 * be an end-to-end test that spans multiple classes that you slap on quickly
	 * for the purposes of refactoring. The end-to-end pinning test is gradually
	 * refined into more high quality unit tests. Sometimes this is necessary
	 * because writing unit tests itself requires refactoring to make the code more
	 * testable (e.g. dependency injection), and you need a temporary end-to-end
	 * pinning test to protect the code base meanwhile.
	 * 
	 * For this deliverable, there is no reason you cannot write unit tests for
	 * pinning tests as the dependency injection(s) has already been done for you.
	 * You are required to localize each pinning unit test within the tested class
	 * as we did for Deliverable 2 (meaning it should not exercise any code from
	 * external classes). You will have to use Mockito mock objects to achieve this.
	 * 
	 * Also, you may have to use behavior verification instead of state verification
	 * to test some methods because the state change happens within a mocked
	 * external object. Remember that you can use behavior verification only on
	 * mocked objects (technically, you can use Mockito.verify on real objects too
	 * using something called a Spy, but you wouldn't need to go to that length for
	 * this deliverable).

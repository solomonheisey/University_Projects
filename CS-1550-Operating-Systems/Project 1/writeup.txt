Explain the pros and cons of using a FIFO queue (as compared to a priority queue) within a semaphore.

One pro of using a FIFO queue is that it is simple to implement. A con would be that shorter jobs can become stuck behind longer ones. A pro to using a priority queue is that they complete tasks based on time. What this means is that the shortest task first minimizes the average wait time. A con to priority queues is that they are more complicated to implement when compared to FIFO queues.
